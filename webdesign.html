                        <h2>For my Graphic Design 4 class, we spent the whole semester independently creating three assignments around a central theme. The theme was assigned at the start of the term, and I was assigned the word "amaranth". The starting concept of my game was to make a sort of adventure game inspired by the Greek myth about the gods hiding an amaranth flower that would make the finder immortal. I had thought it would be cool to have a sort of journey, where the charcter you play as has to go find this amaranth flower to go make them immortal. So the game is a simple runner game following a pegasus on a quest to find the amaranth to become immortal. I drew all the background and characters and created the animations, as well as composed the background music. This game was a huge challenge for me and had a lot of hurdles, but I am excited about the outcome.

                        <h2>This interactive colour experience was created for a class. The brief was to create an
                            interactive visualization that presents insights from a dataset to help answer a question
                            about the particular subject/theme/content. I chose to use the MET museumâ€™s public API to
                            gather images of impressionist and post-impressionist paintings and turned them into an
                            interactive comparative colour analysis website. The goal of the website was to learn more
                            about the similarities and differences of the two art movements with a focus on colour, as
                            colour is significant in both. By offering a variety of relevant filters and scroll effects,
                            I wanted viewers to be able to explore the website and its interactions to be able to
                            compare the data and learn more about the two art movements. I think I created a functional,
                            responsive design to meet my goals and the goals of the assignment, and created an
                            educational tool about art history.</h2>

                            context but it focuses on my process through this project.</h2>
