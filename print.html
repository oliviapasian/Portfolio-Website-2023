                        <br>
                        <h2>I created this poster for a class assignment. The brief was to d"esign a 24” × 36” digital
                            poster about either 1) your life under COVID 19 or 2) how you see the future of design
                            without using software explicitly intended for design". This poster was created inspired by
                            COVID isolation throughout the pandemic and how so much of my socialization was through
                            screens and layers of separation. I tackled themes of loneliness and isolation despite
                            digital connectivity for this poster, and incorporated another layer to it as well using
                            unothodox design tools. I created the poster using a pattern making software clled Stitch
                            Fiddle. During the pandemic, since there was a lot of isolation, I spent a lot of time
                            crocheting, so I chose this tool as an homage to that aspect of the pandemic.</h2>

                            For my Graphic Design 4 class, we spent the whole semester independently creating three assignments around a central theme. The theme was assigned at the start of the term, and I was assigned the word "amaranth". For this assignment, I created a poster and AR experience based around the idea of how amaranth can mean immortality and I thought about how I struggle to keep real flowers alive so I made a realistic flower that can be placed anywhere and will never die. By scanning the QR code on the poster, it links you to the flower, sculpted in Blender and powered by Adobe Aero, and it can be placed in a room and viewed from any angle.
                        </h2>

                        <h2>Here is the experience as seen when the QR code is scanned. It only works on mobile, but to access it you can scan the code on the poster!</h2>
